# Bible-modules-for-eSword
BBLI bible modules for eSword.

Just download the modules you want, and put them in c:\Program Files (x86)\e-Sword

All the files were downloaded from www.crosswire.org and converted with Simple Bible Reader 5.6.2, into a eSword format.

I do not garantee that those bibles are perfect. I only garantee that I downloaded them from crosswire.org and converted them faithfully.

The Nestle1904 is a well known Greek critical text

Vulgate 405 is the Vulgate Jerome finished producing in 405 CE

Sistine Vulgate is the not great version of Pope Sixtus V, in 490

Clementine Vulgate is the corrections made by Pope Clement VIII in 492, to fix the mess of Sixtus V.


The other bibles are self-explanatory. Just Google them, for more info.
